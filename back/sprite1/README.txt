PHP CSS Sprite generator
------------------------

This library will generate both an image, and a css class to 
use as CSS Sprites. This allows a single page load for all 
images on the page.

This library is written in PHP and uses imagemagick.

You will need to chmod your cache directory to make it writeable
by the script.
